### Tutorial: How to Play the Game
  
  --------------------------- Welcome to UNO! ---------------------------
#### Before we begin, let's go through a quick tutorial to get you started.

- To play a card, simply type the card you want to play. For example, if you have a blue 5, type 'b5' to play it.

- If you don't have a playable card in your hand, you can draw from the deck by typing 'draw'.

- Keep an eye on the top card in the discard pile. You can only play a card if it matches either the color or the number of the top card.

- Remember, special action cards can change the game. A 'skip' card skips the next player's turn, a 'reverse' card changes the direction of play, and a 'draw two' card makes the next player draw two cards.

- Pay attention to the color-changing wild cards! You can play a wild card on any color, and a wild draw four card forces the next player to draw four cards.

- Don't worry if you need a refresher during the game. Just type 'help' to see this tutorial again.
